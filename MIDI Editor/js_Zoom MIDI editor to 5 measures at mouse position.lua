ReaScript name: js_Zoom MIDI editor to 5 measures at mouse position.lua

  # Description
  When the MIDI editor's active take is switched via the track list to a take that is out of view, 
  the MIDI editor will automatically "Zoom to content".  If the newly active MIDI take is very large, 
  "Zoom to content" provides a nice overview of the entire item, so that the user can easily locate the 
  relevant MIDI data.  However, zooming in again can be a hassle. 

  This script is therefore intended to provide an easy, one-click action to reset the MIDI editor's zoom 
  level, without requiring the user to change the note, time or loop selection.
  
  # Instructions
  Simply point the mouse to the appropriate position in the MIDI item and press the linked shortcut 
  or mouse modifier.
  
  In the script's USER AREA, the user can change the number of measures that the script zooms to, and
  these modified scripts can be saved under different names and linked to different shortcuts or mouse 
  modifiers.
  
  # Warning
  The script temporarily changes the loop region, so it may be safer to avoid running the script during 
  playback or recording.
