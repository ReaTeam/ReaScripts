  # Description
  When the MIDI editor's active take is switched via the track list to a take that is out of view, 
  the MIDI editor will automatically "Zoom to content".  If the newly active MIDI take is very large, 
  "Zoom to content" provides a nice overview of the entire item, so that the user can easily locate the 
  relevant MIDI data.  However, zooming in again can be a hassle. 
  
  Similarly, when opening multiple MIDI items simultaneously (with Preferences -> MIDI Editor -> Open all selected items),
  the MIDI editor will "zoom to content", trying to fit all the items into the viewport.

  This script is therefore intended to provide an easy, one-click action to zoom in, without requiring 
  the user to change the note, time or loop selection.
  
  The script can either zoom to the mouse position, ir to the edit cursor position:
  
  If the mouse is over a part of the interface that has position info (i.e. the arrange view, the ruler, 
  or the MIDI editor's "notes" or "cc" areas), the MIDI editor will zoom to the mouse position.  
  
  If the mouse is positioned anywhere else (for example the "track list" area of the MIDI editor), 
  the MIDI editor will scroll and zoom to the current position of the edit cursor.
  (Zooming to the edit cursor is particularly useful for returning to the last edit position, after inadvertently scrolling to a faraway item.)
  
  # Instructions
  Simply move the mouse to the position that you want to edit, and press the linked shortcut or mouse modifier.
  
  In the script's USER AREA, the user can change the number of measures that the script zooms to, and
  these modified scripts can be saved under different names and linked to different shortcuts or mouse 
  modifiers.
  
  # Warning
  The script temporarily changes the loop region, so it may be safer to avoid running the script during 
  playback or recording.
