	#### GUIDE

	Meant as an alternative to the native *'Edit: Insert note at mouse cursor'*
	action which inserts a note at the velocity of the last selected note or
	at the velocity set by clicking on the Piano roll graphic keyboard with
	no way to define a constant velocity to which each new note will be set.

	The script is basically the same as the following custom action:

	ACT 3 32060 "26f61be727877d41933795baf400dadf" "Custom: Insert note at velocity 100 (assign to double click in MIDI piano roll mouse modifiers) -- scalable" 40214 40001 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40465 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40463 40464

	but with extra features.

	Unlike with left drag, the length of inserted note is dictated by the setting
	in the *'Notes:'* menu at the bottom of the Piano roll so it equals to the 
	length of current grid division.

	Since the note is inserted at mouse cursor strictly speaking clicking isn't required.

	However if assigned to 'double click' context at *'Preferences -> Mouse modifiers -> 
	MIDI Editor piano roll'*, and you don't want the cursor to move when a note 
	is inserted (default behavior) then make sure that in the parallel slot 
	or one with at least one same modifier under the 'left click' context there's 
	no action (Behavior) which moves the edit cursor, otherwise the first click 
	out of the two will change the edit cursor position.  
	If this can't be ensured, then run it independently of the mouse click,
	that is via a shortcut assigned to the sctript in the Action list.

	▓ ▪ INITIAL VELOCITY

	Initial velocity to which notes inserted with this script will be set to
	is controlled by the user modifiable INIT_VELOCITY parameter in the
	USER SETTINGS below. It is constant until changed via the dialogue.

	▓ ▪ DIALOGUE

	In order to set velocity for all new notes to anything other than INIT_VELOCITY,
	move the mouse cursor away from the Piano roll (e.g. place it above Piano roll
	graphic keyboard or the main toolbar or the bottom part) and run the script.
	In the dialogue which will pop up key in the new velocity value and click 'OK'.
	In order to reset the operational velocity back to the INIT_VELOCITY value
	enter 0 in the dialogue field.

	The velocity value set via the dialogue is stored in the project file.
	If the project file wasn't saved after using the dialogue, in the next
	session the script will start out with INIT_VELOCITY.

	▓ ▪ MODIFIER

	You can set selected notes to the new velocity specified in the dialogue
	by adding any alphabetic character after the velocity value. Select notes
	before calling the dialogue as it blocks the UI.

	If the dialogue is called from inside a floating MIDI Editor window, the window
	will lose focus and will have to be put back into it with a mouse click.
	Until then the script won't run if called with a shortcut.
	
	The script isn't designed to work with MIDI Inline editor.
	
	▓ ▪ IGNORE_MARGINS
	
	This setting prevents REAPER action 'Edit: Insert note at mouse cursor', which
	is used in this script, from inserting a note when the mouse cursor is outside
	of the active Piano roll area on the left (excluding the graphic keyboard) or right 
	(essentially outside of the item bounds) because it may trigger the dialogue 
	when it's uncalled for.  
	This comes at a small price of the edit cursor slightly jolting every time a note 
	is inserted in the active Piano roll area and inability to extend the item by 
	inserting a note outside of its bounds while 'Loop item source' option is OFF.
	
	If you find edit cursor jerks annoying you can disable this setting but then
	try to avoid running the script when the mouse cursor is outside of the active 
	Paino roll area on the left (excluding the graphic keyboard) or right.

-- a trick shared by juliansader; here it's used to make 'modifier' routine undo point register with the Undo_Begin/EndBlock() functions; Undo_OnStateChange() works too but with it the action 'Edit: Insert note at mouse cursor' creates one extra undo point in the 'insert' routine, therefore Undo_Begin/EndBlock() functions must stay
