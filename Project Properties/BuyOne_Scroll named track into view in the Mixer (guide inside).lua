ReaScript name: Scroll named track into view in the Mixer
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058
Version: 1.2
Changelog: #More reliable scroll in different situations
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M for best performance
About:
		As the name suggests, scrolls track with the name, specified
		in the USER SETTINGS into view in the Mixer.
		
		Although can be used by itself, originally was meant to enhance
		Mixer screensets by including in a roundabout way position 
		of certain tracks in the Mixer, because screensets don't store that 
		data with them. And especially with mix templates to quickly access
		different groups of tracks by track name.  
		SWS extension 'Find' tool can bring a track into view in the Mixer
		by name but it requires typing, exclusively selects the track, and
		the track is only placed in the leftmost position in the Mixer.
		
		With this script tracks can be scrolled to the leftmost, the rightmost 
		and central positions in the Mixer according to the POSITION setting.   
		When the Master track is visible in the Mixer the left- and the rightmost
		positions mean to the right and to the left of the Master track respectively.
		
		When the target track is a child in a folder and the folder 
		is collapsed in the Mixer, the parent track will be scrolled into view
		instead. If the target track belongs to one of several nested folders 
		the parent track of the first collapsed folder (if any) to which it belongs 
		will be scrolled into view.   
		If the script happens to fail to determine whether or not the folder
		is collapsed, no scrolling occurs.
		
				U S A G E   W I T H   S C R E E N S E T S
		
		1. In the TRACK_NAME setting specify the name of the track
		you want to be scrolled into view in the Mixer when a screenset
		is loaded.

		2. Create a custom action with the native screenset action
		and the script in it placed in the following order, e.g.:
				Screenset: Load window set #1  
				Scroll named track into view in the Mixer.lua

		3. Use such custom action to load the screenset.
		
		The screenset itself can be saved the regular way but loaded with 
		such custom action whenever you need specific track to be visible
		at the preferred position when the Mixer is opened or when you need 
		to bring the track back into view while the Mixer is already open.

		The script can be duplicated for each track which needs to be scrolled
		into view and then each script instance be included in a separate 
		custom action containing the same screenset action to be used 
		for loading a Mixer screenset while having the Mixer scroll to different 
		tracks. Which basically makes the screenset granular at a track position 
		level in the Mixer.

		If needed the screenset can be loaded directly with the script when
		its number is specified in the SCREENSET setting. Possible disadvantage
		is that the script becomes hard linked with the screenset number.
		
		SWS/S&M Extension
		
		It's recommended to have the SWS/S&M extension installed so that all
		3 track scroll positions are available regardless of the Mixer window width 
		and that child and parent tracks of collapsed folders are always recognized.    
		If not installed then worth being aware of the following:  
		A) in the docked Mixer, central and rightmost positions will only be respected 
		when the Mixer window is open to its full width,   
		if it shares the docker with other windows in split mode (but not in tabbed
		mode) and such other windows are visible any POSITION setting will be clamped 
		to the leftmost;   
		B) in the floating Mixer window only any POSITION setting will be clamped 
		to the leftmost;  
		C) if the MIDI Editor is docked in the same docker as the Mixer, visible or not,
		any POSITION setting will be clamped to the leftmost.  
		D) child target tracks or their folder parent tracks may go unrecognized 
		depeding on the number and size of inserted FX and number of items on the track;		

		BOTTOM LINE, absent the SWS/S&M extension use only leftmost position so the track
		is sure to scroll into view. It could have been hard coded but i opted out just
		to give the user some freedom of choice.
				
		CAVEATS

		The Mixer will not scroll track into the position defined in the USER SETTINGS
		if there're too few tracks or their combined MCPs are too narrow to allow 
		sufficient distance for scrolling.
		
		When the scroll position is the rightmost, one or more extra tracks (depending
		on their MCP width) may be revealed on the right side of the Mixer besides 
		the target track, because the visible tracks may not necessarily fit exactly 
		within the Mixer window. This is especially relevant for setups with mixed 
		MCP layouts due to difference in their widths.
		
		Mind that as of build 6.38 the Mixer window is global for all projects open in tabs,
		just the contents differ. Therefore changing Mixer scroll position in one such project
		will affect it across all open projects.
		
		* * *
		Check out also Save-Load window set with Mixer scroll position (10 scripts)
		for a method of scrolling named track into view with hard linking between 
		track name and screenset number.
