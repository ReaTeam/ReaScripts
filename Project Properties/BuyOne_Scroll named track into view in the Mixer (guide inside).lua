ReaScript name: Scroll named track into view in the Mixer
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058
Version: 1.0
Changelog: Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M for best performance
About:
		As the name suggests, scrolls track with the name, specified
		in the USER SETTINGS into view in the Mixer.
		
		Although can be used by itself, originally was meant to enhance
		Mixer screensets by including in a roundabout way position 
		of certain tracks in the Mixer, because screensets don't store that 
		data with them. And especially with mix templates to quickly access
		different groups of tracks by track name.  
		SWS extension 'Find' tool can bring a track into view in the Mixer
		by name but it requires typing, exclusively selects the track, and
		the track is only placed in the leftmost position in the Mixer.
		
		With this script tracks can be scrolled to the leftmost, the rightmost 
		and central positions in the Mixer according to the POSITION setting.   
		When the Master track is visible in the Mixer the left- and the rightmost
		positions mean to the right and to the left of the Master track respectively.
		
			U S A G E   W I T H   S C R E E N S E T S
		
		1. In the TRACK_NAME setting specify the name of the track
		you want to be scrolled into view in the Mixer when a screenset
		is loaded.

		2. Create a custom action with the native screenset action
		and the script in it placed in the following order, e.g.:
			Screenset: Load window set #1  
			Scroll named track into view in the Mixer.lua

		3. Use such custom action to load the screenset.
		
		The screenset itself can be saved the regular way but loaded with 
		such custom action whenever you need specific track to be visible
		at the preferred position when the Mixer is opened or when you need 
		to bring the track back into view while the Mixer is already open.

		The script can be duplicated for each track which needs to be scrolled
		into view and then each script instance be included in a separate 
		custom action containing the same screenset action to be used 
		for loading a Mixer screenset while having the Mixer scroll to different 
		tracks. Which basically makes the screenset granular at a track position 
		level in the Mixer.

		If needed the screenset can be loaded directly with the script when
		its number is specified in the SCREENSET setting. Possible disadvantage
		is that the script becomes hard linked with the screenset number.

		It's recommended to have the SWS/S&M extension installed so that all
		3 track scroll positions are available regardless of the Mixer window size 
		and of its being docked. If not installed, only the leftmost position will
		be available regardless of the actual POSITION setting.
				
		CAVEATS

		The Mixer will not scroll track into the position defined in the USER SETTINGS
		if there're too few tracks or their combined MCPs are too narrow to allow 
		sufficient distance for scrolling.
		
		When the scroll position is the rightmost, one or more extra tracks (depending
		on their MCP width) may be revealed on the right side of the Mixer besides 
		the target track, because the visible tracks may not necessarily fit exactly 
		within the Mixer window. This is especially relevant for setups with mixed 
		MCP layouts due to difference in their widths.
		
		Mind that as of build 6.38 the Mixer window is global for all projects open in tabs,
		just the contents differ. Therefore changing Mixer scroll position in one such project
		will affect it across all open projects.

-- Insert target track name between the double square brackets,

-- Insert position value between the quotation marks, see legend.
-- Insert screenset number between the quotation marks, only if you intend
-- to use the script to load the screenset rather than combine it with native
-- 'Screenset: Load window set #...' action inside a custom action
-- In the custom action the script must FOLLOW the native action

TRACK_NAME = [[]] -- preferably unique in your project/mix template to avoid confusion

-- Being set with the function SetMixerScroll() the leftmost track is always displayed in full which may cause the rightmost track be partially shifted beyond the Mixer right edge or the Master track if it's displayed on the right side (because MCPs combined width doesn't fit within the Mixer window); this is mitigated by shifting the target track back leftwards which is a trade-off and may reveal one or more extra tracks on the right, depending on the width of the leftmost track

-- Since track layouts may have different width plus some may stop flush at the right edge but others may not a mechanism is employed to shift the position back to the left which may reveal additional tracks on the right depending on MCP widths
-- When target position is center or right but there're not enough tracks which come before the target track or their comdined width isn't enough to fill up the space between the left edge or the Master track and the target track, the target track will be placed only as far to the right as the conditions permit
