About:	
		To be used instead of native 'Screenset: Save/Load window set #[number]' actions
		in situations where track position in the Mixer is important. Position means
		the leftmost, center and the rightmost.   
		The script does both:  
		a) concurrently with saving the actual screenset stores the track 
		to be scrolled into view when the Mixer is opened with the screenset 
		whose number is included in the script name; and   
		b) loads the screenset scrolling the associated track into view.		
		
		To save a screenset with a track to be scrolled into view in the Mixer:  
		1) make sure that the track which is supposed to be scrolled into view 
		on opening has a name and it's unique to avoid confusion;   
		2) open the Mixer and either select the target track or make it 
		the leftmost;  
		3) !!!! CRUCIAL: open 'Screensets/Layout' window (is used to signal 
		to the script that saving needs to be performed, it's not stored 
		in screensets);   
		4) run the script ('Screensets/Layout' window will auto-close);   
		5) 'Save Windows Screenset' dialogue will appear.  
		On Windows once you click save in the 'Save Windows Screenset' dialogue, 
		the chosen track name will be stored concurrenty with the screenset (re)saving. 
		If the dialogue is cancelled no storage occurs.   
		On MacOS and on Linux track name storage will have to be manually 
		confirmed or declined via a dialogue which will appear once 'Save Windows Screenset' 
		dialogue closes. That's because without access to MacOS or Linux i couldn't 
		devise the same way of track name storage as on Windows.
				
		To change track name associated with a screenset, load the screenset 
		and follow the abovelisted steps.  
		On Windows track name is only stored if the screenset itself 
		is re-saved even with no changes to it.   
		On MacOS and on Linux they can be stored independently thanks to the 
		additional dialogue, which turns out to be both the curse and the 
		blessing so to speak.
		
		When storing, selected track gets preference, when no track is selected 
		the script looks for the leftmost track in the Mixer.   
		If 'Screensets/Layout' window isn't open while the Mixer is open, the script 
		will work in screenset loading mode provided there's a stored track name.
		
		To determine the position to scroll the track to, the script evaluates the 
		track displayed name. By default without any tags in its name the track is 
		scrolled to the leftmost position. To change that precede the track displayed 
		name with a scroll tag in the following format: C/c> (center); R/r> (rightmost)
		e.g. "C> My track name"   
		The register of the characters doesn't matter hence both types are listed.
		To have the track scroll into view at the start of the Mixer (leftmost position)
		when its name is already tagged, it suffices to strip the scroll tag of the 
		letter, leaving only the greater '>' sign intact, e.g. "> My track name".
		
		To load the screenset and scroll into view a track whose name was stored,
		run the script.
		
		After saving the screenset using this script, if the need arises to modify 
		the screenset by changing Mixer dock state, window size, it can be done
		the usual way via the corresponding action or 'Screensets/Layouts window',
		but loaded this screenset must still be with this script.
		
		The script is linked to the track name, so if the stored name is applied 
		to a different track, it will become the one to be scrolled into view in the Mixer 
		when the screenset is loaded, provided the name isn't shared with any other track.
		
		When the target track is a child in a folder and the folder 
		is collapsed in the Mixer, the parent track will be scrolled into view
		instead. If the target track belongs to one of several nested folders the parent 
		track of the first collapsed folder (if any) to which it belongs will be 
		scrolled into view.   
		If the script happens to fail to determine whether or not the folder
		is collapsed, no scrolling occurs.
		
		SWS/S&M Extension
		
		It's recommended to have the SWS/S&M extension installed so that all
		3 track scroll positions are available regardless of the Mixer window width 
		and that child and parent tracks of collapsed folders are always recognized.    
		If not installed then worth being aware of the following:  
		A) in the docked Mixer, central and rightmost positions will only be respected 
		when the Mixer window is open to its full width,   
		if it shares the docker with other windows in split mode (but not in tabbed
		mode) and such other windows are visible any POSITION setting will be clamped 
		to the leftmost;   
		B) in the floating Mixer window only any POSITION setting will be clamped 
		to the leftmost;  
		C) if the MIDI Editor is docked in the same docker as the Mixer, visible or not,
		any POSITION setting will be clamped to the leftmost.  
		D) child target tracks or their folder parent tracks may go unrecognized 
		depeding on the number and size of inserted FX and number of items on the track;		

		BOTTOM LINE, absent the SWS/S&M extension use only leftmost position so the track
		is sure to scroll into view. It could have been hard coded but i opted out just
		to give the user some freedom of choice.
				
		CAVEATS
		
		If there're too few tracks on either end of the tracklist or their combined MCPs 
		are too narrow to allow sufficient distance for scrolling, the stored track will 
		be placed only as close to the target position as conditions permit.
		
		Generally the relative placement of a track at the center and on the right side 
		of the Mixer is accurate. But it still depends on the stored track and adjacent 
		tracks MCP width especially with a tracklist mixed in terms of MCP layouts.  
		Therefore at times some track may appear slightly off center or slightly to the 
		left of the right edge instead of being flush with it.   
		However in determining track placement its visibility is given top priority.
		At the leftmost position the track is always flush with the left edge of the 
		window or with the Master track.
		
		Mind that as of build 6.28 the Mixer window is global for all projects 
		open in tabs, just the contents differ. Therefore changing Mixer scroll 
		position in one such project will affect it across all open projects.

		for a method of scrolling named track into view without hard linking between
		track name and screenset number.
