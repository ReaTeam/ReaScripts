ReaScript name: Automatically increase height of selected tracks, decrease others'
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058
Version: 1.0
Changelog: Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
About:	The script works similalrly to the combination of preference  
        'Always show full control panel on armed track' and option 
	'Automatic record-arm when track selected' for any track in that 
	it expands selected track TCP up to the size specified 
        in the USER SETTINGS and contracts any de-selected TCP down to the size specified 
        in the USER SETTINGS. 

        After launch the script runs in the background.  
        To stop it start it again and interact with the 'ReaScript task control' dialogue.

        C A V E A T S  &  N O T E S

        In the Arrange view track selection only works with a mouse click.

        Shift+Click for batch track selection doesn't work, for multi-selection 
        Ctrl+Click must be used, for a workaround see paragraph B) below.  

        The actions 'Track: Go to next/previous track [leaving other tracks selected]' 
        only work when MIN_HEIGHT setting is explicitly set to the theme specific 
        minimum track height, is empty, invalid or 0 in which case it defaults 
        to the theme specific minimum track height.

        There're two workarounds with regard to the actions:  
        A) using auxiliary Lua scripts with the code provided at the bottom of this script 
        bound to up/down arrow keys and optionally modifiers  
        B) using REAPER built-in Track Manager with options 'Mirror track selection' 
        and optionally 'Scroll to selected track when mirroring selection'. Navigation 
        with up/down arrow keys in the Track Manager and batch selection with Shift+Click 
        mimic the behavior unsupported in the Arrange view.

        If user defined MIN_HEIGHT value is smaller than the theme minimal track height, 
        the latter will be used.

        Children tracks in collapsed folders and tracks whose height is locked 
        are ignored as their height cannot be changed.

        If the script is linked to a toolbar button it will be lit while the script is running.

-- Enable this setting by inserting any alphanumeric

-- Insert values for Max and Min track heights between the quotes
-- If empty, invalid or 0, default to 100
-- and the theme minimal track height respectively,
-- if fractional, is rounded down to the integer
-- and if rounding results in 0  or value smaller

-- If parent folder track is selected

-- THE FEATURE IS PRETTY ADVENTEROUS THEREFORE PLEASE USE

-- ANY FOLDER TRACKS
-- Multi-selection of tracks which includes folder children
-- tracks is very prone to intense flickering;
-- if the code provided at the bottom of this file

-- to create multi-selections, this problem can be avoided

INSTRUCTIONS:

Create 4 Lua files naming them as follows, character register is immaterial:
Go to next track
Go to previous track
Go to next track leaving other tracks selected
Go to previous track leaving other tracks selected

Basically the same as the native actions.

They can have different names as long as they contain the words:
next;
previous;
next, leaving, selected;
previous, leaving, selected;

Copy and paste the code found between 'SNIP' lines below
into each of the 4 files, place the files in the /Scripts folder
under REAPER resource directory, import them into the Action list,
bind to up/down arrow keys optionally with modifiers.
