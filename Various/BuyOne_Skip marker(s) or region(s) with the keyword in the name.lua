ReaScript name: Skip marker(s) or region(s) with the keyword in the name
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058
Version: 1.0
Changelog: Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
About: 	During playback or recording the script makes the play cursor skip marker(s) 
	or region(s) containing in their name a keyword defined in the KEYWORD setting 
	in the USER SETTINGS. Once launched the script runs in the background.

	By default it skips markers, to switch to skipping regions enable USE_REGIONS 
	setting in the USER SETTINGS.

	USING MARKERS

	Place one marker with the name containing the KEYWORD before the segment 
	to be skipped and another one without the KEYWORD at the end of such segment. 
	As soon as the play cursor reaches the 1st marker it will jump to the 2nd one.  
	If in between there're any markers whose name also contains the KEYWORD 
	the segment which follow will be skipped as well. So the play cursor skips
	to the first marker which doesn't contain the KEYWORD in the name following 
	a marker which does.

	USING REGIONS

	Encompass with a region a timeline segment which needs to be skipped 
	and add the KEYWORD to its name.   
	Once the play cursor reaches the start of the region whose name contains 
	the KEYWORD it will jump to such region's end thereby skipping it. If there're 
	several such regions in a row with no gaps, the play cursor jumps to the end 
	of the last one which precedes a region without the KEYWORD in its name 
	or the end of the project.  
	If the script is launched while the play cursor is within a region which 
	contains the KEYWORD in its name, such region won't be marked for skipping. 
	Only regions which lay ahead of the play cursor are detected for skipping.

	RECORDING

	Recording will be done in segments. After skipping a marker or a region 
	a new segment will begin. The start time of the next segment will depend 
	on the pre-roll setting available in the Metronome configuration window. 
	If pre-roll isn't enabled the recording will start as soon as the play cursor 
	jumps to another marker or a region end.

	It's not recommended to move markers and regions around or change regions 
	bounds during playback or recording because their data are only updated after 
	skipping. If they're moved beforehand the target point won't change and 
	the play cursor will end up at the location which may not correspond 
	to the new marker / region end position. If you do move them around, then 
	the script might need re-starting.

	As far as recording is concerned the script does in essense what can be 
	done natively with 'Auto-punch selected items' feature https://youtu.be/bjb8G6jnkUo

	If the script is linked to a toolbar button the button will be lit while 
	it's running.
